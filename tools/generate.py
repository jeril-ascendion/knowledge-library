AUTHORING CONVENTIONS — single source of truth for every substantive page
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These rules apply to every authored content page. The build enforces what it
can mechanically and documents the rest as guidance. New conventions are added
here when established; the comment below grows over time.

PAGE STRUCTURE (in order, every substantive page):
  1. # H1 title
  2. Description paragraph
  3. **Section:** `{slug}/` | **Subsection:** `{sub}/`
  4. **Alignment:** Standard 1 | Standard 2 | Standard 3 | Standard 4
  5. ---
  6. ## What "X" actually means        — definitional opening
  7. ## Six principles                  — exactly 6 numbered flip cards
  8. ## Architecture Diagram            — heading + intro + Mermaid
  9. ## Common pitfalls when adopting X — exactly 5 ⚠️ flip cards
 10. ## Adoption checklist              — 10 rows, ‖ separator triggers cards
 11. ## Related                         — chip row of 4–6 sister pages
 12. ## References                      — numbered list, all hyperlinked

LINK SECURITY (mechanical, build halts on violation):
  Every hyperlink in every page and content must be verified secure.
  - All URLs use https:// (http:// rejected)
  - No domains on KNOWN_INSECURE_DOMAINS blocklist
  - See verify_link_security() below for the enforcement code.
  - Add new bad-cert domains to the blocklist when reported; the next
    build catches every URL pointing at them.

EMBLEM MOTION MECHANICS (each page must use a DISTINCT mechanic):
  Every emblem must use a categorically different animation primitive,
  not just different geometry around the same recipe. Catalogue so far:
    ai-native            → particle flow (centripetal convergence)
    domain-specific      → shape oscillation (whole shapes drift in/out)
    foundational         → rigid-body rotation (pendulum)
    modernization        → cross-fade metamorphosis (two forms trade visibility)
    cloud-native         → elastic replication (pods appear/disappear in waves)
    patterns/data        → sequential frame illumination (fixed frames take turns
                           being highlighted; motion is time, not movement)
    patterns/deployment  → progressive threshold fill (a fill region grows
                           left-to-right through canary checkpoints, pausing
                           at each threshold; only the fill boundary moves)
    patterns/integration → bidirectional pulsation (two stable nodes pulse
                           in turn — scale + emphasis — while a static channel
                           brightens between pulses; nothing translates)
    patterns/security    → concentric perimeter tracing (rings draw themselves
                           into existence around a protected asset, building
                           defence in depth via stroke-dashoffset path tracing;
                           no translation, no scale, no fade)
    patterns/structural  → accretive composition (nine tiles in a 3×3 grid; the
                           core appears first, then the eight surrounding
                           modules accrete around it in spiral order; all hold,
                           all fade simultaneously; monotonic buildup followed
                           by unison reset, distinct from elastic replication's
                           oscillating waves and from sequential frame
                           illumination's pre-existing-frame highlighting)
    system-design/edge-ai → peripheral asynchronous pulse (six edge nodes
                           around a faint distant centre, each pulses (radius +
                           fill) on independent staggered phases sharing the
                           same period; parallel-independent rather than the
                           sequential alternation of bidirectional pulsation)
    system-design/event-driven → wave propagation (a single ring expands from
                           a source point — radius animates 0→50 — while three
                           subscriber dots at staggered distances flash
                           terracotta as the wavefront reaches them; distinct
                           from concentric perimeter tracing because the radius
                           itself grows rather than the path being drawn along
                           a fixed-radius circle)
    system-design/ha-dr  → primary-standby handoff (two persistent identical
                           rectangles; the active role's terracotta fill swaps
                           between them periodically with two role-swap events
                           per cycle; both shapes remain identical in geometry,
                           only colour/role swaps; distinct from cross-fade
                           metamorphosis where the two forms differ
                           geometrically)
    system-design/scalable → scaling envelope (five rectangles in a row; count
                           of active terracotta rectangles rises 1→2→3→4→5
                           and falls 5→4→3→2→1 across nested time intervals
                           centred at the cycle midpoint; distinct from
                           sequential frame illumination because multiple are
                           active simultaneously, and from accretive
                           composition because the envelope rises AND falls
                           rather than monotonic-buildup-then-bulk-fade)
    technology/ui-ux-cx  → layered depth reveal (three offset rectangles
                           representing UI/UX/CX layers reveal in z-axis depth
                           order — back-to-front — via opacity; all hold; all
                           fade simultaneously; distinct from cross-fade
                           metamorphosis where two GEOMETRICALLY DIFFERENT
                           forms swap, and from accretive composition where
                           tiles appear in spiral order)
    technology/api-backend → bidirectional pipeline traffic (two horizontal
                           lanes; in the upper lane request dots flow
                           left-to-right, in the lower lane response dots
                           flow right-to-left; continuous bidirectional
                           traffic; distinct from radial particle convergence
                           by being parallel-linear rather than radial)
    technology/databases → sedimentation stacking (small items appear at the
                           top, fall under gravity to a floor line, accumulate
                           into a stacked row; once full, all dissolve and the
                           cycle restarts; vertical translation with
                           accumulation, distinct from scaling envelope's
                           in-place colour swap and from accretive
                           composition's spiral appearance)
    technology/cloud     → sweeping beam scan (a vertical beam line translates
                           left-to-right across the canvas; six fixed dots at
                           staggered positions briefly flash terracotta as
                           the beam passes their column; distinct from radial
                           particle flow by being a single linear sweep with
                           reactive fixed receivers, and from wave propagation
                           by being a translating line rather than expanding
                           radius)
    technology/devops    → conveyor loop (five dots traverse a closed
                           rectangular path continuously; each dot is at a
                           different position around the loop; the pipeline
                           is never empty; distinct from radial particle
                           convergence and from bidirectional pipeline traffic
                           by being a single closed-loop perimeter traversal
                           rather than radial-inward or parallel-linear)
    technology/practice-circles → cardinal cluster cycle (four dot clusters
                           — three dots each — arranged in cardinal positions
                           N/E/S/W around a faint centre; each cluster lights
                           up in turn (cluster-level sequential illumination),
                           then the centre brightens to indicate
                           cross-pollination; distinct from sequential frame
                           illumination by having clusters as the unit and
                           an explicit cross-pollination phase, and from
                           peripheral asynchronous pulse by being synchronised
                           within clusters and sequential between them)
    technology/engagement-models → tier ascent (a token — small square —
                           progresses up three platform steps in sequence
                           representing Staffing → Managed Capacity →
                           Managed Services; the token holds at the top tier
                           briefly, then fades out and the cycle restarts
                           with a fresh token at the bottom; distinct from
                           conveyor loop by being unidirectional staircase
                           progression with a fade-and-restart, not closed
                           loop, and from scaling envelope by being a single
                           ascending token rather than an array)
    security/application-security → filtration cascade (five dots fall from
                           top through three horizontal filter layers at
                           y=30, y=50, y=70; some dots are blocked at each
                           layer and fade out, two reach the bottom and
                           briefly turn terracotta as they hit the protected
                           application baseline; distinct from progressive
                           threshold fill by having discrete items that
                           travel rather than a region that grows, and from
                           sedimentation stacking by having items rejected
                           at multiple intermediate layers rather than
                           accumulating on a single floor)
    security/authentication-authorization → challenge-response handshake
                           (two persistent shapes — a Subject rectangle on
                           the left and a Resource rectangle on the right;
                           tokens shuttle back and forth alternately, one
                           direction at a time, with explicit rest between
                           exchanges; the receiving node briefly turns
                           terracotta as the token arrives; distinct from
                           bidirectional pulsation by being sequential
                           discrete token movement rather than simultaneous
                           node activation, and from bidirectional pipeline
                           traffic by being one token at a time alternating
                           direction rather than continuous parallel flows
                           in opposite lanes)
    security/cloud-security → shield envelope pulsation (three concentric
                           rings around a persistent terracotta core asset
                           expand and contract in unison — same keyTimes,
                           synchronised breathing rhythm — over a 6s cycle;
                           rings at radii 12↔18, 22↔28, 32↔38; distinct
                           from concentric perimeter tracing which uses
                           stroke-dashoffset to draw rings sequentially,
                           and from wave propagation which has a single
                           ring expanding centrifugally from a source and
                           disappearing — here multiple rings persist and
                           breathe together)
    security/encryption  → key-merge / unmerge (two persistent shapes — a
                           data rectangle on the left and a key circle on
                           the right — translate toward the centre, fade
                           out as a single ciphertext rectangle fades in,
                           hold as ciphertext for the encrypted phase, then
                           reverse: ciphertext fades out, original two shapes
                           fade back in and translate to original positions;
                           distinct from particle flow which has many
                           particles converging from periphery to a single
                           central point — here it is two named persistent
                           shapes that meet and re-separate, and from
                           cross-fade metamorphosis which trades visibility
                           in the same spatial position with no movement —
                           here the two original shapes physically translate)
    security/vulnerability-management → triage funnel (eight dots enter
                           wide at the top of a visible inverted-trapezoid
                           funnel — diagonal walls drawn explicitly; six
                           descend through the funnel and four make it to
                           the narrow bottom output line, where they
                           briefly turn terracotta as remediated; the other
                           dots are blocked at the diagonal walls and fade;
                           distinct from filtration cascade which uses
                           horizontal filter layers as the visual constraint
                           — here the constraint is geometric convergence
                           via the funnel's diagonal walls; distinct from
                           particle flow which has radial centripetal
                           convergence to a central point)
    ai-native/architecture → token streaming emergence (six small dots in
                           a horizontal row appear one at a time from left
                           to right over a 6s cycle, each persisting after
                           appearance, building cumulatively until the full
                           row is visible — the autoregressive token-by-
                           token generation; after a brief hold all dots
                           clear simultaneously and the cycle restarts;
                           distinct from sequential frame illumination
                           which has frames take TURNS being lit — only
                           one active at a time, not cumulative; distinct
                           from sedimentation stacking which has items fall
                           VERTICALLY and accumulate on a floor — here the
                           emergence is HORIZONTAL with simultaneous clear)
    ai-native/ethics     → disparate-rate progression (two horizontal
                           progress bars side by side fill at independent
                           speeds — top bar fills 0→100% in 4s, bottom
                           bar fills in 6s, each cycles at 8s — visualising
                           the asymmetry between groups receiving the same
                           task; the visible rate difference IS the message,
                           fairness as the relationship between filling
                           rates; distinct from progressive threshold fill
                           which has a SINGLE region growing through canary
                           checkpoints; distinct from scaling envelope
                           which has a row of rectangles where the COUNT
                           of active rectangles rises and falls — here
                           two CONTINUOUS fill bars with disparate rates)
    ai-native/monitoring → rolling time-series window (five dots emerge
                           on the right edge of the canvas with staggered
                           phases over a 4s base cycle, shift left in
                           unison through five slot positions, with the
                           oldest dot exiting on the left edge and fading;
                           continuous unidirectional FIFO flow, the time
                           series in motion; distinct from conveyor loop
                           which is a CLOSED rectangular circuit where
                           items return to the start — here items have
                           explicit entry on the right and exit on the
                           left; distinct from particle flow which is
                           RADIAL centripetal convergence to a central
                           point — here LINEAR horizontal flow with
                           FIFO replacement; distinct from bidirectional
                           pipeline traffic which has TWO opposite-
                           direction parallel flows)
    ai-native/rag        → nearest-neighbor retrieval (a central terracotta
                           query node sits at the canvas centre with eight
                           stationary corpus nodes arranged in a ring
                           around it; each cycle three specific corpus
                           nodes light terracotta and connect to the centre
                           via thin terracotta lines, then fade back to

                           to the right; the reversal-on-detection is the
                           visual signature, animating the architectural
                           reality that detected adversarial inputs are

                           to y=52 (visible obstacles in the flow);
                           a terracotta ellipse marker (cx=16, cy=45,
                           rx=4, ry=4) traverses the path via cx
                           animation through five phases — start at
                           x=16, cross to x=46 (friction zone 1),
                           cross to x=80 (friction zone 2), cross
                           to x=104 (endpoint); at each friction
                           zone the ellipse COMPRESSES — rx animates
                           4→3 (slowed forward motion) and ry
                           animates 4→2 (squeezed vertically) over
                           a brief window, then relaxes back; after
                           reaching x=104, a terracotta completion
                           marker (r=2.6) appears at the endpoint

                           shape compression; #69 is the first
                           mechanic to use ellipse rx/ry compression
                           to encode friction along a traversal
                           path — the architectural signature is
                           task-flow-with-friction: usability is not
                           the absence of friction but the ratio of
                           progress to friction across the path,
                           and the compression-and-resume rhythm
                           encodes that good UX acknowledges friction
                           explicitly rather than hiding it)

                           y=78; three sequential "token paths" at
                           y=24, 45, 66 each carry a terracotta
                           CIRCLE (r=3.5) on the LEFT SIDE that
                           moves from x=14 to x=58 (just before
                           boundary), then at the boundary the
                           circle FADES OUT and a terracotta SQUARE
                           (rect 6×6) FADES IN at the same y
                           position, then the SQUARE moves from
                           x=62 to x=104 (right side); the three
                           paths run SEQUENTIALLY (not simultaneously)
                           with timing offsets — path 1 at t=
                           0.10–0.32, path 2 at t=0.30–0.52, path 3
                           at t=0.50–0.72; after all three crossings
                           complete, the three squares remain on the
                           right side and pulse via width and height

                           horizontal traversal — that uses a single
                           shape moving across uniform track with no
                           transformation, #73 has TWO DISTINCT
                           SHAPES representing different data states
                           with explicit transformation event at
                           boundary; distinct from #54 dual-track
                           parallel lifecycle — that has two parallel
                           horizontal tracks for two version blocks,
                           #73 has one track per path but with a
                           transformation point dividing pre- and
                           post-states; distinct from #67 dual-node
                           failover alternation — that has two
                           static nodes alternating, #73 has one
                           moving entity per path that changes form
                           during traversal; distinct from #68
                           stacked control-layer verification —
                           that has a marker descending vertically
                           through layers emitting per-layer stamps,
                           #73 has markers traversing horizontally
                           across a single boundary with shape
                           change; the architectural signature is
                           state-transformation-at-trust-boundary:
                           data exists in different forms on either
                           side of a trust boundary, and the
                           boundary's purpose is to perform the
                           transformation that converts sensitive to
                           non-sensitive form before propagation)
  Future pages must invent a new mechanic, not reuse one.
  Two colours only: warm neutral (#D6D2C8) + terracotta (#C96330).
  Basic SMIL primitives only (animate, animateTransform with type=rotate or translate; stroke-dasharray and opacity animations also valid via animate).
  No animateMotion / mpath (proven unreliable across browsers).

STUB CONTENT IS LOREM IPSUM:
  When a page is still a stub, only its TITLE and TAXONOMY (the
  section/subsection placement) are settled. The body text is a
  placeholder — feel free to expand it freely with proper content,
  add explanations, restructure it. Do not treat seed-generated
  stub prose as committed copy.

NO REPETITION ACROSS PAGES:
  Don't repeat the same concept, principle, or paragraph across
  multiple pages unless it is genuinely necessary (e.g. one page
  explicitly extends a concept from another, or a foundational
  concept is referenced as background). Each page should own its
  distinct lane. When two pages would naturally cover the same
  ground, reference the other page rather than restating.
