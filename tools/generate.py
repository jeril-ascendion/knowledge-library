AUTHORING CONVENTIONS — single source of truth for every substantive page
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These rules apply to every authored content page. The build enforces what it
can mechanically and documents the rest as guidance. New conventions are added
here when established; the comment below grows over time.

PAGE STRUCTURE (in order, every substantive page):
  1. # H1 title
  2. Description paragraph
  3. **Section:** `{slug}/` | **Subsection:** `{sub}/`
  4. **Alignment:** Standard 1 | Standard 2 | Standard 3 | Standard 4
  5. ---
  6. ## What "X" actually means        — definitional opening
  7. ## Six principles                  — exactly 6 numbered flip cards
  8. ## Architecture Diagram            — heading + intro + Mermaid
  9. ## Common pitfalls when adopting X — exactly 5 ⚠️ flip cards
 10. ## Adoption checklist              — 10 rows, ‖ separator triggers cards
 11. ## Related                         — chip row of 4–6 sister pages
 12. ## References                      — numbered list, all hyperlinked

LINK SECURITY (mechanical, build halts on violation):
  Every hyperlink in every page and content must be verified secure.
  - All URLs use https:// (http:// rejected)
  - No domains on KNOWN_INSECURE_DOMAINS blocklist
  - See verify_link_security() below for the enforcement code.
  - Add new bad-cert domains to the blocklist when reported; the next
    build catches every URL pointing at them.

EMBLEM MOTION MECHANICS (each page must use a DISTINCT mechanic):
  Every emblem must use a categorically different animation primitive,
  not just different geometry around the same recipe. Catalogue so far:
    ai-native            → particle flow (centripetal convergence)
    domain-specific      → shape oscillation (whole shapes drift in/out)
    foundational         → rigid-body rotation (pendulum)
    modernization        → cross-fade metamorphosis (two forms trade visibility)
    cloud-native         → elastic replication (pods appear/disappear in waves)
    patterns/data        → sequential frame illumination (fixed frames take turns
                           being highlighted; motion is time, not movement)
    patterns/deployment  → progressive threshold fill (a fill region grows
                           left-to-right through canary checkpoints, pausing
                           at each threshold; only the fill boundary moves)
    patterns/integration → bidirectional pulsation (two stable nodes pulse
                           in turn — scale + emphasis — while a static channel
                           brightens between pulses; nothing translates)
    patterns/security    → concentric perimeter tracing (rings draw themselves
                           into existence around a protected asset, building
                           defence in depth via stroke-dashoffset path tracing;
                           no translation, no scale, no fade)
    patterns/structural  → accretive composition (nine tiles in a 3×3 grid; the
                           core appears first, then the eight surrounding
                           modules accrete around it in spiral order; all hold,
                           all fade simultaneously; monotonic buildup followed
                           by unison reset, distinct from elastic replication's
                           oscillating waves and from sequential frame
                           illumination's pre-existing-frame highlighting)
    system-design/edge-ai → peripheral asynchronous pulse (six edge nodes
                           around a faint distant centre, each pulses (radius +
                           fill) on independent staggered phases sharing the
                           same period; parallel-independent rather than the
                           sequential alternation of bidirectional pulsation)
    system-design/event-driven → wave propagation (a single ring expands from
                           a source point — radius animates 0→50 — while three
                           subscriber dots at staggered distances flash
                           terracotta as the wavefront reaches them; distinct
                           from concentric perimeter tracing because the radius
                           itself grows rather than the path being drawn along
                           a fixed-radius circle)
    system-design/ha-dr  → primary-standby handoff (two persistent identical
                           rectangles; the active role's terracotta fill swaps
                           between them periodically with two role-swap events
                           per cycle; both shapes remain identical in geometry,
                           only colour/role swaps; distinct from cross-fade
                           metamorphosis where the two forms differ
                           geometrically)
    system-design/scalable → scaling envelope (five rectangles in a row; count
                           of active terracotta rectangles rises 1→2→3→4→5
                           and falls 5→4→3→2→1 across nested time intervals
                           centred at the cycle midpoint; distinct from
                           sequential frame illumination because multiple are
                           active simultaneously, and from accretive
                           composition because the envelope rises AND falls
                           rather than monotonic-buildup-then-bulk-fade)
    technology/ui-ux-cx  → layered depth reveal (three offset rectangles
                           representing UI/UX/CX layers reveal in z-axis depth
                           order — back-to-front — via opacity; all hold; all
                           fade simultaneously; distinct from cross-fade
                           metamorphosis where two GEOMETRICALLY DIFFERENT
                           forms swap, and from accretive composition where
                           tiles appear in spiral order)
    technology/api-backend → bidirectional pipeline traffic (two horizontal
                           lanes; in the upper lane request dots flow
                           left-to-right, in the lower lane response dots
                           flow right-to-left; continuous bidirectional
                           traffic; distinct from radial particle convergence
                           by being parallel-linear rather than radial)
    technology/databases → sedimentation stacking (small items appear at the
                           top, fall under gravity to a floor line, accumulate
                           into a stacked row; once full, all dissolve and the
                           cycle restarts; vertical translation with
                           accumulation, distinct from scaling envelope's
                           in-place colour swap and from accretive
                           composition's spiral appearance)
    technology/cloud     → sweeping beam scan (a vertical beam line translates
                           left-to-right across the canvas; six fixed dots at
                           staggered positions briefly flash terracotta as
                           the beam passes their column; distinct from radial
                           particle flow by being a single linear sweep with
                           reactive fixed receivers, and from wave propagation
                           by being a translating line rather than expanding
                           radius)
    technology/devops    → conveyor loop (five dots traverse a closed
                           rectangular path continuously; each dot is at a
                           different position around the loop; the pipeline
                           is never empty; distinct from radial particle
                           convergence and from bidirectional pipeline traffic
                           by being a single closed-loop perimeter traversal
                           rather than radial-inward or parallel-linear)
    technology/practice-circles → cardinal cluster cycle (four dot clusters
                           — three dots each — arranged in cardinal positions
                           N/E/S/W around a faint centre; each cluster lights
                           up in turn (cluster-level sequential illumination),
                           then the centre brightens to indicate
                           cross-pollination; distinct from sequential frame
                           illumination by having clusters as the unit and
                           an explicit cross-pollination phase, and from
                           peripheral asynchronous pulse by being synchronised
                           within clusters and sequential between them)
    technology/engagement-models → tier ascent (a token — small square —
                           progresses up three platform steps in sequence
                           representing Staffing → Managed Capacity →
                           Managed Services; the token holds at the top tier
                           briefly, then fades out and the cycle restarts
                           with a fresh token at the bottom; distinct from
                           conveyor loop by being unidirectional staircase
                           progression with a fade-and-restart, not closed
                           loop, and from scaling envelope by being a single
                           ascending token rather than an array)
  Future pages must invent a new mechanic, not reuse one.
  Two colours only: warm neutral (#D6D2C8) + terracotta (#C96330).
  Basic SMIL primitives only (animate, animateTransform with type=rotate).
  No animateMotion / mpath (proven unreliable across browsers).

STUB CONTENT IS LOREM IPSUM:
  When a page is still a stub, only its TITLE and TAXONOMY (the
  section/subsection placement) are settled. The body text is a
  placeholder — feel free to expand it freely with proper content,
  add explanations, restructure it. Do not treat seed-generated
  stub prose as committed copy.

NO REPETITION ACROSS PAGES:
  Don't repeat the same concept, principle, or paragraph across
  multiple pages unless it is genuinely necessary (e.g. one page
  explicitly extends a concept from another, or a foundational
  concept is referenced as background). Each page should own its
  distinct lane. When two pages would naturally cover the same
  ground, reference the other page rather than restating.

# Convention: "Every hyperlink in every page and content must be verified

# values, plus every markdown hyperlink inside every README) and rejects:
#   1. Any URL not using https:// — http and other schemes are insecure

# When a new bad-cert domain is reported, add it to the blocklist below and
# the next build will fail until the URL is replaced. Replacement is always
