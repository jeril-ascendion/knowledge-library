add_card "principles/ai-native"       "AI-Native"        "PARTICLE FLOW"                "Many small particles converge to a central reasoning core. Distributed inputs becoming one thought."
add_card "principles/domain-specific" "Domain-Specific"  "SHAPE OSCILLATION"            "Two whole shapes — circle and square — drift inward, briefly overlap, then return to their lanes."
add_card "principles/foundational"    "Foundational"     "RIGID-BODY ROTATION"          "A pendulum. Fixed pivot, rhythmic swing — natural easing at extremes, fast through centre."
add_card "principles/modernization"   "Modernization"    "CROSS-FADE METAMORPHOSIS"     "A monolith form cross-fades into a service grid. Two complete forms trading visibility in the same space."
add_card "principles/cloud-native"    "Cloud-Native"     "ELASTIC REPLICATION"          "Centre pod always present; surrounding pods appear and recede in waves under load."
add_card "patterns/data"              "Data Patterns"    "SEQUENTIAL FRAME ILLUMINATION" "Four temporal frames take turns being highlighted. The motion is time, not movement."
add_card "patterns/deployment"        "Deployment Patterns" "PROGRESSIVE THRESHOLD FILL" "A fill region grows left-to-right through canary checkpoints, pausing at each threshold. The motion is the deployment process itself."
add_card "patterns/integration"       "Integration Patterns" "BIDIRECTIONAL PULSATION" "Two nodes pulse in turn while a static channel brightens between them. The motion is the conversation: speak, transit, respond, transit, rest."
add_card "patterns/security"          "Security Patterns" "CONCENTRIC PERIMETER TRACING" "Concentric rings draw themselves into existence around a protected asset, building defence in depth. The motion is line-tracing along closed paths."
add_card "patterns/structural"        "Structural Patterns" "ACCRETIVE COMPOSITION" "Nine tiles assemble in a 3×3 grid — core first, then surrounding modules in spiral order — hold, then dissolve simultaneously. The motion is composition itself."
add_card "system-design/edge-ai"       "Edge AI Systems"        "PERIPHERAL ASYNCHRONOUS PULSE" "Six edge nodes around a faint distant centre, each pulsing on its own staggered phase. The rhythm of asynchronous on-device inference — devices working on independent clocks with no coordinator."
add_card "system-design/event-driven"  "Event-Driven Systems"   "WAVE PROPAGATION"             "A single ring expands from a source point — radius grows, opacity fades — while subscribers at staggered distances flash as the wavefront reaches them. The motion is the event itself, propagating outward through indifferent receivers."
add_card "system-design/ha-dr"         "HA & DR Systems"        "PRIMARY-STANDBY HANDOFF"      "Two identical replicas; the active role swaps periodically between them. Both shapes are persistent, identical in geometry — only the colour and the role indicator move."
add_card "system-design/scalable"      "Scalable Systems"       "SCALING ENVELOPE"             "Five rectangles in a row; the count of active rectangles rises 1→5 then falls 5→1 across nested time intervals. The motion is the load curve itself: capacity rising to meet demand, then receding when the surge passes."
add_card "technology/ui-ux-cx"          "UI, UX & CX"               "LAYERED DEPTH REVEAL"           "Three offset rectangles — CX, UX, UI — reveal back-to-front in sequence. The motion is the design stack itself: customer experience as the outer envelope, user experience the layer within, user interface the surface that touches the user."
add_card "technology/api-backend"       "API & Backend Technologies" "BIDIRECTIONAL PIPELINE TRAFFIC" "Two parallel horizontal lanes carry dots in opposite directions — request flows down, response flows up. The motion is the contract: every request is owed a response, every response was preceded by a request, the pipeline runs continuously."
add_card "technology/databases"         "Databases"                  "SEDIMENTATION STACKING"         "Five small items fall from above and accumulate at the floor in sequence, building up a stack. The motion is persistence itself: data settles, accumulates, becomes durable; the floor is the storage layer that catches everything."
add_card "technology/cloud"             "Cloud"                      "SWEEPING BEAM SCAN"             "A vertical beam line translates left to right; fixed dots flash terracotta as the beam passes. The motion is the cloud control plane sweeping over distributed resources — discovering, observing, evaluating each one in turn."
add_card "technology/devops"            "DevOps"                     "CONVEYOR LOOP"                  "Five dots travel a closed rectangular path continuously, each at a staggered position around the loop. The motion is the pipeline: continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment — work moves around the loop without ever stopping."
add_card "technology/practice-circles"  "Practice Circles"           "CARDINAL CLUSTER CYCLE"         "Four small dot clusters arranged at cardinal positions cycle through being lit, with the centre brightening to indicate cross-pollination between circles. The motion is the practice itself: communities working in parallel, sharing what they learn at the centre."
add_card "technology/engagement-models" "Engagement Models"          "TIER ASCENT"                    "A token climbs three persistent platform steps in sequence — Staffing, Managed Capacity, Managed Services — before resetting. The motion is the maturity arrow: partnerships ascending through tiers as trust accumulates over engagements."
