## Overview

Defining SLIs, setting SLO targets, error budget policy, and SLA contractual alignment.

This document is part of the **Observability** body of knowledge within the Ascendion Architecture Best-Practice Library. It provides comprehensive, practitioner-grade guidance aligned to industry standards and extended for AI-augmented, agentic, and LLM-driven design contexts.

## Core Principles

### 1. Intentional Design for SLI/SLO/SLA

Every aspect of sli/slo/sla must be deliberately designed, not discovered after deployment. Document design decisions as ADRs with explicit rationale.

### 2. Consistency Across the Portfolio

Apply sli/slo/sla practices consistently across all systems. Inconsistent application creates governance blind spots and makes incident investigation unpredictable.

### 3. Alignment to Business Outcomes

SLI/SLO/SLA practices must demonstrably contribute to business outcomes: reduced downtime, faster delivery, lower operational cost, or improved compliance posture.

### 4. Evidence-Based Quality Assessment

Quality of sli/slo/sla implementation must be measurable. Define specific metrics and collect evidence continuously — not only at audit or review time.

### 5. Continuous Evolution

Standards for sli/slo/sla evolve as technology and threat landscapes change. Schedule quarterly reviews of applicable standards and update practices accordingly.

## Implementation Guide

**Step 1: Current State Assessment**

Document the current state of sli/slo/sla practice: what is implemented, what is missing, what is inconsistent across teams. Use the governance/scorecards section for a structured assessment framework.

**Step 2: Gap Analysis Against Standards**

Compare current state against the standards in this section and applicable frameworks (OpenTelemetry — CNCF Standard, Google SRE Book). Prioritize gaps by business impact and remediation effort.

**Step 3: Design the Target State**

Define the target sli/slo/sla state: which patterns will be adopted, which anti-patterns eliminated, which governance mechanisms introduced. Express as a time-bound roadmap.

**Step 4: Incremental Implementation**

Implement sli/slo/sla improvements incrementally: pilot with one team or system, measure outcomes, refine the approach, then expand. Avoid big-bang transformations.

**Step 5: Validate and Iterate**

Measure the impact of implemented changes against defined success criteria. Incorporate lessons learned into the practice standards. Contribute improvements back to this library.

## Governance Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Owner | Gate Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current State Documented | Solution Architect | SLI/SLO/SLA current state assessment completed and reviewed | Required |
| Gap Analysis Reviewed | Architecture Review Board | Gap analysis reviewed and prioritization approved | Required |
| Implementation Plan Approved | Enterprise Architect | Target state and roadmap approved by ARB | Required |
| Quality Metrics Defined | Solution Architect | Measurable success criteria defined for sli/slo/sla improvements | Required |

## Recommended Patterns

### Reference Architecture Adoption

Start from an established reference architecture for sli/slo/sla rather than designing from scratch. Adapt to organizational context rather than rebuilding proven foundations.

### Pattern Library Contribution

When your team solves a recurring sli/slo/sla problem with a novel approach, document it as a pattern for the library. This compounds organizational knowledge over time.

### Fitness Function Testing

Encode sli/slo/sla standards as automated architectural fitness functions — tests that run in CI/CD and fail builds when standards are violated. This makes governance continuous rather than periodic.


---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ⚠️ Standards Theater

Documenting sli/slo/sla standards in architecture policies that no one reads and no one enforces. Standards without automated validation or governance gates are not operational standards.

### ⚠️ Copy-Paste Architecture

Adopting another organization's sli/slo/sla patterns wholesale without adapting to organizational context, team capability, or regulatory environment. Always adapt; never just copy.


---

## AI Augmentation Extensions

### AI-Assisted Standards Review

LLM agents analyze design documents against sli/slo/sla standards, generating structured gap reports with cited evidence and suggested remediation approaches.

> **Note:** AI review accelerates governance but does not replace expert architectural judgment. Use as a first-pass filter before human review.

### RAG Integration for SLI/SLO/SLA

This section is optimized for vector ingestion into an AI-powered architecture assistant. Semantic search enables architects to retrieve relevant sli/slo/sla guidance through natural language queries.

> **Note:** Reindex the vector store whenever section content is updated to ensure retrieved guidance reflects current standards.
